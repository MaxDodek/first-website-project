<h1> Max Dodek</h1>

 <P> My interests are playing tennis, and board games with family. I enjoy learning about business, and am an entrepreneur. I have a business called Max Drone Photos, as well as a <a href= "https://maxdronephotos.wixsite.com/website"> website </a>. I like reading books and watching Netflix. I decided to do this course not only because I enjoy working on computers, but also because learning about computers, and coding will be a very important skill for me in the future. Many successful business people know a lot about computers, and coding. I am interested in computers because I want to be a successful entrepreneur, and it will be important for me to know a lot about computers, and coding in order for me to be one. I hope to learn a bit about the computer language, so I can be able to code by myself in the future and create cool things in the future by coding. </P>
